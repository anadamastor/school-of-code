## TEAM A

Team A demonstrates a solid understanding of DOM manipulation concepts in JavaScript, just two minor comments on line 39 and 83.

Considering the team has only used LET - I would nudge to start thinking about the implications of using LET and CONST.

Can push forward on trying new challenges such as events.

## TEAM B - comments

I enjoy the playfulness that comes out from the challenge - the team has been trying really hard to complete it.

The lack of clear structure and comments makes it almost impossible to correct. I would suggest to identify the challenges first and reduce the overall cognitive/

Overall there ismMajor code duplication. I believe there is a lack of understanding of variables and I would like to explore with the team more in depth this concepts.

However there are a couple of overlooks I would like to highlight with the team as soon as possible.

It looks like the team hasn't yet fully grasped the concept of "variable" and this explains the major code duplication.

Traversing the DOM: is happening but there is some confusion. Traversing skipped at times.

Styling Elements: the solutions that are implemented work well, how can we refactor the code to reduce duplication?

Manipulation of the DOM: it works well but can do some code duplication.
