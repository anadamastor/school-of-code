## TEAM A

Team A demonstrates a solid understanding of DOM manipulation concepts in JavaScript, just two minor comments on line 39 and 83.

It's noteworthy that the team has mainly used `let` for variable declarations. I would encourage them to consider the implications of using both `let` and `const` could improve their code quality and maintainability.

Considering the great solutions the have implemented, I encourage to team to explore new challenges such as events handling and, generally, play more with the code.

## TEAM B

I really enjoy the playfulness that comes out straight at the beginning of the challenge (the `console.log("hi")`). 

 It is clear the team has been trying really hard to complete the challenges but there are some areas of growth.

The lack of clear structure and comments makes it very difficult for a teacher to provide feedback, I would insist on this as first point to address. 

Another major issue observed is significant code duplication, indicating a potential lack of understanding of variables. Exploring this concept in-depth with the team could be extremely beneficial at this stage.

While the team demonstrates some capability in traversing and styling elements, there are instances of confusion and skipped traversal steps. 

The solutions for styling elements and DOM manipulation are great and effective. As a next step I would ask the team how to refactor them - at this stage they have done a great work.

There is great value in this challenge because it has spotted some areas that need to be addresses as soon as possible (clarity, variables, and code duplication).

Overall, Team B shows great curiosity, resilience and brilliant DOM manipulations skills.
